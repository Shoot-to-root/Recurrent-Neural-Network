## Standard RNN
The network architecture of the standard RNN model has a SimpleRNN layers, and one output
layer with ‘softmax’ as its activation function. Root mean squared propagation method is used to
optimize cross entropy loss with a learning rate of 0.01. The network takes an input sequence
length of 40 and 3 steps.

## LSTM
The network architecture of the LSTM model has one LSTM layer, and one output layer with
‘softmax’ as its activation function. Root mean squared propagation method is used to optimize
cross entropy loss with a learning rate of 0.01. The network takes an input sequence length of 40
and 3 steps.
